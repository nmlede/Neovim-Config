# __Neovim-Config__

This is my own neovim setup .

At the moment it is a simple configuration but it meets what I currently need.

My idea is to include new functionalities as I consider them necessary in my day to day life.

Inside the directory are a simple installer written in bash, the neovim plugins and their configurations.

## __Requirements:__

- Neovim > 0.5 (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
- Vim-Plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- Ctags for the Tagbar plugin (https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags)

## __Installation:__

1. git clone https://github.com/nmlede/Neovim-Config.git
2. cd Neovim-Config/Neovim
3. bash Install.sh
4. Follow the instructions
5. After instalation, you most run :PlugInstall on nvim
6. Enjoy!

## __Work in progress.__
